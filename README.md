üí° **Notes:**
- The conjugate heat transfer (CHT) interface couples the **die, vapor chamber, heat sink, and air** regions.
- Fans are represented as rotating reference frames (MRF) or rigid-body motion (RBM) zones depending on simulation setup (both cases were sim'ed).
- The **heat sink** is treated as a **porous region** to account for detailed fin flow resistance while retaining conjugate heat transfer effects.  
- The vapor chamber is modeled as an orthotropic solid to represent the high in-plane heat spreading provided by the embedded wick and vapor core. In detailed simulations, a true vapor chamber is often represented by a five-layer structure (top cover, top wick, vapor core, bottom wick, and bottom cover) to capture phase-change and capillary effects. For demonstration purposes, this model simplifies the vapor chamber into a single anisotropic solid block with equivalent thermal properties and can be off by as mubh as 10%-15%.
