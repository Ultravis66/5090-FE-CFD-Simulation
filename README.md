- First test run to ensure thermals and fans are spinning
- Flow through porous medium working
- Heat transfer through all mediums working as intended
- Done to ensure all multiphysics is working as intended

üí° **Notes:**
- The conjugate heat transfer (CHT) interface couples the **die, vapor chamber, heat sink, and air** regions.
- Fans are represented as rotating reference frames (MRF) or rigid-body motion (RBM) zones depending on simulation setup (both cases were sim'ed).
- The **heat sink** is treated as a **porous region** to account for detailed fin flow resistance while retaining conjugate heat transfer effects.  
- The vapor chamber is modeled as an orthotropic solid to represent the high in-plane heat spreading provided by the embedded wick and vapor core. In detailed simulations, a true vapor chamber is often represented by a five-layer structure (top cover, top wick, vapor core, bottom wick, and bottom cover) to capture phase-change and capillary effects. For demonstration purposes, this model simplifies the vapor chamber into a single anisotropic solid block with equivalent thermal properties and can be off by as mubh as 10%-15%.

- This visualization models transient conjugate heat transfer through the RTX 5090 FE under a 600 W thermal load. The GPU die receives 450 W, and the PCB receives 150 W (future project would actually model the memory modules).
- Dual fans are simulated with Rigid Body Motion (RBM) to generate realistic airflow and convection through the porous heat-sink region.
- The simulation captures full heat transfer across the die, vapor chamber, heat sink, and PCB.

## Pressure Analysis

### Static Pressure Results

**Inlet Static Pressure:** ~10 Pa (average)  
**Outlet Static Pressure:** ~-0.4 Pa (average)  
**Pressure Drop:** ŒîP ‚âà 10.4 Pa

![Inlet Static Pressure](Static_P_in.png)
![Outlet Static Pressure](Static_P_out.png)

### Static Pressure Interpretation:

The pressure drop across the heatsink assembly is approximately 10.4 Pa, which is relatively low for a GPU cooling solution. This indicates:

- **Low flow resistance** through the fin stack
- **Significant flow bypass** around the porous media
- **Dead zones** with stagnant air contributing to reduced effective flow area

The negative outlet pressure (-0.4 Pa) indicates a slight vacuum condition at the exhaust, typical for pusher fan configurations where air expands into open space after exiting the heatsink.

### Flow Characteristics

- **Volume-averaged velocity through fins:** 0.515 m/s
- **Velocity in active flow regions:** ~1.5 m/s
- **Estimated effective fin utilization:** ~33%

This significant discrepancy between local and average velocities reveals that approximately 2/3 of the fin area experiences poor or stagnant flow, representing a major design inefficiency in the Founders Edition cooling architecture.

## The video below shows the blockage from the dead zone closer to center as well as from the heat pipes:

## Temperature Analysis

### Coolant Temperature Results

**Inlet Temperature:** ~70¬∞C (average)  
**Outlet Temperature:** ~64¬∞C (average)  
**Temperature Change:** ŒîT ‚âà -6¬∞C (cooling)

![Inlet Temperature](Medium_Temp_in.png)
![Outlet Temperature](Medium_Temp_out.png)

### Flow Stagnation and Hot Spots

The counterintuitive temperature drop (inlet hotter than outlet) reveals a critical design flaw in the cooling architecture. This occurs due to:

- **Flow stagnation zones** where air becomes trapped with poor circulation
- **Non-uniform flow distribution** through the porous media
- **Hot pockets** forming in blocked regions (70¬∞C) while main flow paths remain cooler (64¬∞C)

The inlet temperature monitor is capturing air in a stagnant/recirculation zone that has been heated significantly, while the outlet monitor measures the primary flow path where air moves more freely through the fins.

### Porous Media Temperature Distribution

![Porous Media Temperature Contour](Por_Temps.png)

The temperature contour clearly shows:
- **Non-uniform thermal distribution** across the heatsink
- **Hot spots** correlating with dead flow zones
- **Significant temperature gradients** indicating poor flow coupling

With only ~33% of the fin area receiving adequate airflow (1.5 m/s in active regions vs 0.515 m/s average), approximately 2/3 of the heatsink mass is underutilized, creating localized thermal buildup and reducing overall cooling efficiency.

### Design Implications

This represents a fundamental flaw in the Founders Edition cooling design where aesthetic considerations and packaging constraints have created flow bypass paths and stagnation zones, leaving significant cooling performance on the table.
